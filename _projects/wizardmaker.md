The purpose of this system is to make it much easier to create high quality, computer-assisted, step-by-step instructions (commonly called wizards). We have some preliminary evidence that sustainability groups and other non-profits would benefit from such a tool. It is quite possible that we will not come up with a design that allows most content experts, relatively unskilled with computers, to easily create a wizard. So before we code, we will investigate proposed designs and try to determine the feasibility of the project.
