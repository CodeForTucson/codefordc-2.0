<div class="col-lg-10">
We are currently emphasizing two different projects: Communityshare and
an ongoing effort to organize educational hackathons in the Tucson area.

## Communityshare

Matches specialists and learning opportunities with students and classrooms.

### Current Needs
 - Simplify the developer experience to lower the barrier-to-entry for new contributors.
 - Identify and organize usability and functionality issues in [GitHub](github.com/communityshare/communityshare/issues).
 - Document the existing code structure and architecture.

## Local Education

Organizing civic hackathons and organizing events to educate and inspire
the next generation of programmers.
