  <p class="wtm-space">Google Developer Groups, Code for Tucson, and UAZ Libraries are proud to present the 3rd annual Women Techmakers Tucson Hackathon from September 30 - October 1 at the University of Arizona's Science-Engineering Library. Join us for a weekend of food, fun, learning, and hacking!  We are proud to offer a diverse set of workshops and childcare for participants during workshop hours. ​​This free event provides an opportunity for participants of all levels of technical expertise to collaboratively develop tech-driven projects over the course of two days.  All are encouraged to attend — no computer programming experience required.  Projects are never built by ones and zeros alone — designers, product managers, community organizers, writers, and YOU are very much welcome!</p>
